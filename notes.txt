Hi, I'm Andy Sterkowitz. I help people land their dream job as a software developer.
I taught myself to code in 2014 and have obsessed with helping others do the same.

Some might call me a full stack developer in that I work in everything from HTML/CSS, Javascript, C# and SQL. My true love is building new applications and application features that result in an awesome user interaction.

If I'm not working on a computer you can find me relieving stress at the gym, watching an NBA game or traveling the planet.
